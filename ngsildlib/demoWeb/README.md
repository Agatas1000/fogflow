# Javascript NGSI-LD library web demo 

This is a PoC demo web page showing the operation of the NGSI-LD javascript library coded for the FogFlow framework.

The result of this PoC has to be seen in the developper console of the browser of choice.

## Convenience script

A convenience script has been provided with this demo: [runWeb](./runWeb.sh) which will launch an nginx server via docker, configure das a static content server as well as reverse proxy for the Scorpio broker.
