Motivation
===============================

FogFlow is an IoT edge computing framework, which is designed to address the following concerns: 

    - The cost of a cloud-only solution is too high to run a large scale IoT system with >1000 geo-distributed devices

    - Many IoT services require fast response time, such as <10ms end-to-end latency

    - Service providers are facing huge complexity and cost to fast design and deploy their IoT services in a cloud-edge environment - business demands are changing fast over time and service providers need to try out and release any new services over their shared cloud-edge infrastructure at a fast speed

    - Lack of programming model to fast design and deploy IoT services over geo-distributed ICT infrastructure

    - Lack of interoperability and openness to share and reuse data and dervied results across various applications

With FogFlow, service providers can easily programme their IoT services with minimal development effort
and also they are able to release new IoT services with fast time-to-market. 
On the other hand, for IoT platform operators, FogFlow can help them to seamlessly server latency-sensitive IoT services over cloud and edges 
with low operation cost and optimized QoS. 


High level view
===============================

The unique feature of FogFlow is *"context-driven"*. 
FogFlow is able to orchestrate dynamic data processing flows over cloud & edges 
based on three types of contexts, including 

*System context*: dynamics, geo-distributed, heterogeneity 

*Data context*: be able to see the content of generated data (type, attributes, metadata, relations) 

*Usage context*:
