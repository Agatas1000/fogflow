Motivation
===============================

The cost of a cloud-only solution is too high to run a large scale IoT system with >1000 geo-distributed devices

many IoT services require fast response time, such as <10ms end-to-end latency

service providers are facing huge complexity and cost to fast design and deploy their IoT services in a cloud-edge environment - business demands are changing fast over time and service providers need to try out and release any new services over their shared cloud-edge infrastructure at a fast speed

lack of programming model to fast design and deploy IoT services over geo-distributed ICT infrastructure

lack of interoperability and openness to share and reuse data and dervied results across various applications


High level view
===============================

To orchestrate dynamic data processing flows over cloud & edges based on two types of contexts:
System context: dynamics, geo-distributed, heterogeneity 
Data context: be able to see the content of generated data (type, attributes, metadata, relations)
