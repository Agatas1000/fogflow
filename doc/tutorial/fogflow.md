**Description:** 
This is an Introductory Tutorial to [FogFlow](https://eprosima-fast-rtps.readthedocs.io).
In the FIWARE-based architecture, FogFlow can be used to dynamically trigger data processing functions 
between IoT devices and Orion Context Broker, for the purpose of transforming and preprocessing raw data at edge nodes, 
which can be deployed at IoT gateways or directly on the devices like Raspberry Pis.

The tutorial introduces a typical FogFlow system setup with a simple example to do anomaly detection at edges for temperature sensor data.

# What is FogFlow?

[FogFlow](https://fogflow.readthedocs.io) is an IoT edge computing framework 
to automatically orchestrate dynamic data processing flows over cloud and edges driven by context, 
including system context on the available system resources from all layers, 
data context on the registered metadata of all available data entities, 
and also usage context on the expected QoS defined by users.

# System View

This section explains an example usecase implementation using Fogflow and Fiware Orion in integration with each other. The context data generated by Fogflow will be subscribed by the Orion Broker.
Suppose...


# Start Up FogFlow

Here are the prerequisite commands for starting Fogflow:
1. docker
2. docker-compose

For ubuntu-16.04, you need to install docker-ce and docker-compose.

To install Docker CE, please refer to [Install Docker CE](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04), required version 18.03.1-ce;
*please also allow your user to execute the Docker Command without Sudo*

To install Docker Compose, please refer to [Install Docker Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-16-04), required version 18.03.1-ce, required version 2.4.2

**Setup Fogflow:**

Download the docker-compose file and the config.json file to setup flogflow.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartfog/fogflow/master/docker/core/docker-compose.yml

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartfog/fogflow/master/docker/core/config.json
```
you need to change the following addresses in config.json according to your own environment.

- **webportal_ip**: this is the IP address to access the FogFlow web portal provided by Task Designer. It must be accessible from outside by user's browser.  
- **coreservice_ip**: it is used by all edge nodes to access the FogFlow core services, including Discovery, Broker(Cloud), and RabbitMQ;
- **external_hostip**: this is the same as coreservice_ip, for the cloud part of FogFlow;        
- **internal_hostip**: is the IP of your default docker bridge, which is the "docker0" network interface on your host

**Firewall rules:** to make your FogFlow web portal accessible via the external_ip; the following ports must be open as well: 80, 443, 8080, and 5672 for TCP
    
Pull the docker images of all FogFlow components and start the FogFlow system
```bash
docker-compose pull

docker-compose up -d
```
Check all the containers are Up and Running using "docker ps -a"
```bash

**Test the Fogflow Dashboard:**

Open the link “http://<webportal_ip>” in your browser to check the status of all FogFlow running components in the cloud.
So now you can also check all the components using dashboard.

# Start Up Orion

You may follow the orion docs to set up a Orion Context Broker instance from here: [Installing Orion](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/admin/install/index.html)

You may also setup Orion on docker using below commands.(docker and docker-compose are required for these method)
Note: Orion container has a dependency on MongoDB database.

## Easiest way to setup Orion (docker is ):

**Prerequisite:** Docker should be installed.

First launch MongoDB container using below command:
```bash
sudo docker run --name mongodb -d mongo:3.4
```

And then run Orion with this command
```bash
sudo docker run -d --name orion1 --link mongodb:mongodb -p 1026:1026 fiware/orion -dbhost mongodb
```

Check that everything works with
```bash
curl localhost:1026/version
```

# Program a simple fog function via FogFlow Dashboard
**Create a simple Fog Function that:**
- accepts "Temperature" Entity Type as SelectCondition, "id" as granularity and "all" as SelectedAttributes,
- publishes a context entity of type "result" in Streams.

# Simulate an IoT device
**Temperature type device simulation can be used instead of manual update. (Pending)**
## 1. Simulate devices:
## 2. Run the simulated devices:

# Trigger the Fog Function

## There are two ways to trigger the fog function:**

**1. Create a “Temperature” sensor entity by filling the following element**
 - **Device ID:** to specify a unique entity ID.
 - **Device Type:** use “Temperature” as the entity type.
 - **Location:** use “Temperature” as the entity type.

**2. Send an NGSI entity update to create the “Temperature” sensor entity**
 - Send a curl request to the FogFlow broker for entity update:
 ```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://<Fogflow IP>:8080/ngsi10/updateContext' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '
{
    "contextElements": [
        {
            "entityId": {
                "id": "Temperature001",
                "type": "Temperature",
                "isPattern": false
                },
            "attributes": [
                    {
                    "name": "temperature",
                    "type": "float",
                    "contextValue": 73
                    },
                    {
                    "name": "pressure",
                    "type": "float",
                    "contextValue": 44
                    }
                ],
            "domainMetadata": [
                    {
                    "name": "location",
                    "type": "point",
                    "value": {
                    "latitude": -33.1,
                    "longitude": -1.1
                    }}
                ]
        }
    ],
    "updateAction": "UPDATE"
}'
```

**To check if the fog function is triggered:**
 - Check if a task is created under "Task" in System Management.
 - Check if a Stream is created under "Stream" in System Management.

# Issue a subscription to forward the generated result to Orion Context Broker
**Use the following curl request to subscribe Fogflow Broker to FIWARE Orion:**

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://<Fogflow IP>:8080/ngsi10/subscribeContext' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  -H 'Destination: orion-broker'  \
  -d '
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": ".*",
      "type": "result",
      "isPattern": true
    }
  ],
  "reference": "http://<Orion IP>:1026/v2"
}'
```
**Please note that this subscription request does not use any restrictions and attributes, it is a general subscription request based of entity type.**

# Query the result from Orion Context Broker
**Visit the following URL in your browser and search for the desired context entities:**
```bash
http://<Orion IP>:1026/v2/entities/
```
